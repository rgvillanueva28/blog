But! I was very obsessed with Python that time, since it was the only language that was taught to us.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I created an Deep Learning chatbot which is on console or terminal only. When I finally made the thing work, I researched if it is possible to create websites using python. I then learned about Django Framework which is a very popular framework but on backend. My groupmate has a template for a website so we used it and tweaked it a bit.</p>
<p>I was very slow in creating the project since I am not also very good in Python. However, I am enjoying it since I am learning, not only Django, but also Javascript.</p>
<p>I was enjoying much that after the project is functional, I also added a voice functionality for the chatbot. If I'm not mistaken, almost half of the time creating the project was on the voice functionality. I never thought of surrendering that time since I am very eager to learn.
We successfully made the project in time and received a high grade for it. You can check our project in github using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CoDev-20/Covid19Chatbot">this link</a>.</p>
