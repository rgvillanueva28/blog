<p>However, there was this one website which provides data about Covid-19 in the Philippines which is from the Department of Health (DOH). I examined the website using the google chrome developer tools (I always refer to this as inspect element) to try and find possible source for the data. I clicked all the items under network tab until I found out the source of the data. I wasn't expecting it at all since I was just tinkering around. I then used this API for my version 1 which is I think created using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arcgis.com/index.html">ArcGIS</a>. After sometime, the API was taken down by the DOH. I don't know the reason but I think that too many API calls or traffic was on the server. I knew that I am only borrowing the API so I fetch data only once a day since DOH only updates once a day.</p>
<p>The need for version 2 with a new data source arises. The search for new source of data has commenced.  I found <a target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/">https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://covid19.mathdro.id/">https://covid19.mathdro.id/</a> and used them. Unlike the data source for version 1, the new data source does not have data on the Persons under Monitor (PUM) and Persons under Investigation (PUI), so I removed them. I added a new feature for version 2 which is Region.</p>
<p>Eventually, I sticked only to a single data source which is <a target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/">https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/</a>. I added new features which is rates, and fresh cases. I called this changed version 3.</p>
<p>The DOH again changed their public data source which is a dependency for the version 3 data source. The search for new data source has again commenced. I eventually sticked to <a target="_blank" href="https://disease.sh/">https://disease.sh/</a> as the new and current data source. Many features are also added which includes active cases, critical cases, tests conducted, total, and per million.</p>
