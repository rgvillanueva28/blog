It then came to my mind that this should be a website since it will be used by people. I don't have any experience in building websites that time. I only know basic html and no CSS or Javascript. But! I was very obsessed with Python that time, since it was the only language that was taught to us.\n\nIn the beginning, I created an Deep Learning chatbot which is on console or terminal only. When I finally made the thing work, I researched if it is possible to create websites using python. I then learned about Django Framework which is a very popular framework but on backend. My groupmate has a template for a website so we used it and tweaked it a bit.\n\nI was very slow in creating the project since I am not also very good in Python. However, I am enjoying it since I am learning, not only Django, but also Javascript.\n\nI was enjoying much that after the project is functional, I also added a voice functionality for the chatbot. If I'm not mistaken, almost half of the time creating the project was on the voice functionality. I never thought of surrendering that time since I am very eager to learn.\nWe successfully made the project in time and received a high grade for it.

So, out of curiosity, I asked myself, \"what if I create a chatbot on messenger?\" During that time, Covid-19 cases in the Philippines was actively monitored. So, I hunt for available APIs that time but I can't find any.\n\nHowever, there was this one website which provides data about Covid-19 in the Philippines which is from the Department of Health (DOH). I examined the website using the google chrome developer tools (I always refer to this as inspect element) to try and find possible source for the data. I clicked all the items under network tab until I found out the source of the data. I wasn't expecting it at all since I was just tinkering around. I then used this API for my version 1 which is I think created using [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html). After sometime, the API was taken down by the DOH. I don't know the reason but I think that too many API calls or traffic was on the server. I knew that I am only borrowing the API so I fetch data only once a day since DOH only updates once a day.\n\nThe need for version 2 with a new data source arises. The search for new source of data has commenced.  I found [https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/](https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/) and [https://covid19.mathdro.id/](https://covid19.mathdro.id/) and used them. Unlike the data source for version 1, the new data source does not have data on the Persons under Monitor (PUM) and Persons under Investigation (PUI), so I removed them. I added a new feature for version 2 which is Region.\n\nEventually, I sticked only to a single data source which is [https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/](https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/). I added new features which is rates, and fresh cases. I called this changed version 3.\n\nThe DOH again changed their public data source which is a dependency for the version 3 data source. The search for new data source has again commenced. I eventually sticked to [https://disease.sh/](https://disease.sh/) as the new and current data source. Many features are also added which includes active cases, critical cases, tests conducted, total, and per million.\n\nYou can check the project on [this link](https://covid-chatbot-ph.herokuapp.com/).","excerpt":"After we created the project AI chatbot, I am still eager to learn coding with Python.

It then came to my mind that this should be a website since it will be used by people. I don't have any experience in building websites that time. I only know basic html and no CSS or Javascript. But! I was very obsessed with Python that time, since it was the only language that was taught to us.\n\nIn the beginning, I created an Deep Learning chatbot which is on console or terminal only. When I finally made the thing work, I researched if it is possible to create websites using python. I then learned about Django Framework which is a very popular framework but on backend. My groupmate has a template for a website so we used it and tweaked it a bit.\n\nI was very slow in creating the project since I am not also very good in Python. However, I am enjoying it since I am learning, not only Django, but also Javascript.\n\nI was enjoying much that after the project is functional, I also added a voice functionality for the chatbot. If I'm not mistaken, almost half of the time creating the project was on the voice functionality. I never thought of surrendering that time since I am very eager to learn.\nWe successfully made the project in time and received a high grade for it.

So, out of curiosity, I asked myself, \"what if I create a chatbot on messenger?\" During that time, Covid-19 cases in the Philippines was actively monitored. So, I hunt for available APIs that time but I can't find any.\n\nHowever, there was this one website which provides data about Covid-19 in the Philippines which is from the Department of Health (DOH). I examined the website using the google chrome developer tools (I always refer to this as inspect element) to try and find possible source for the data. I clicked all the items under network tab until I found out the source of the data. I wasn't expecting it at all since I was just tinkering around. I then used this API for my version 1 which is I think created using [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html). After sometime, the API was taken down by the DOH. I don't know the reason but I think that too many API calls or traffic was on the server. I knew that I am only borrowing the API so I fetch data only once a day since DOH only updates once a day.\n\nThe need for version 2 with a new data source arises. The search for new source of data has commenced.  I found [https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/](https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/) and [https://covid19.mathdro.id/](https://covid19.mathdro.id/) and used them. Unlike the data source for version 1, the new data source does not have data on the Persons under Monitor (PUM) and Persons under Investigation (PUI), so I removed them. I added a new feature for version 2 which is Region.\n\nEventually, I sticked only to a single data source which is [https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/](https://coronavirus-ph-api.herokuapp.com/). I added new features which is rates, and fresh cases. I called this changed version 3.\n\nThe DOH again changed their public data source which is a dependency for the version 3 data source. The search for new data source has again commenced. I eventually sticked to [https://disease.sh/](https://disease.sh/) as the new and current data source. Many features are also added which includes active cases, critical cases, tests conducted, total, and per million.\n\nYou can check the project on [this link](https://covid-chatbot-ph.herokuapp.com/).","excerpt":"After we created the project AI chatbot, I am still eager to learn coding with Python.
